============================

Configuring for the first time:

git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

===========================

Creating an online repository:

Use the GitHub website

===========================

Creating an offline (local) repository:

mkdir ~/MyProject	The ~/ ensures that we’re building the repository at the top level of your computer’s file structure

cd ~/MyProject		Entering the project directory

===========================

Initialize Git:

git init		Makes the current directory a Git repository

===========================

Accessing and creating files:

touch Readme.txt	"touch" creates a untracked file

git status		gives a list of what is in the repository

git add Readme.txt	this makes the file tracked and a part of the repository

git commit -m "Add Readme.txt"	creates a commit (snapshot state) of the repository at this point - think of it as a saved backup of the project. The "-m" just adds a descriptory message to the commit written in present tense.

===========================

Connecting local and GitHub repositories:

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/myproject.git		origin indicates a new place that files will orginate from, remote is a descriptor of origin to indicate the files are not on the pc but online

git remove -v 	confirms and lists the connections

===========================

Uploading or "Pushing" changes to the remote repo:

git push origin master		to push the master branch of the local repository
